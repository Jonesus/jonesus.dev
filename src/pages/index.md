Welcome to my website! I'm Joonas, M.Sc. in Computer Science, majoring in
Human-Computer Interaction from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). I'm
currently employed as the lead application developer at
[Hematoscope Lab](https://www.hematoscopelab.com/), where we aim to modernize
hematological experts' workflows by providing them with deep learning and
computer vision based tools for increased accuracy and efficiency.

While you're here, check out what I've been working on at the
[projects page](/projects), or take a look at some general topics I've written
about at the [blog page](/blog).

The student association (a.k.a guild) for bioinformation technology in
[Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/), [Inkubio](https://www.inkubio.fi/),
has long published a print magazine called S'napsi. From time to time, the
editor-in-chief would grace the editorial volunteers with a call for a web
issue, and in 2017 I wanted to try my hands at the technical implementation.

As this was practically my first foray into web development, the chosen stack
was quite basic; HTML, CSS and JS. A simple website with content dynamically
hidden and shown based on [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) callbacks on `<a>` tags,

- interactivity with embedded rpgmaker games and timelapses
